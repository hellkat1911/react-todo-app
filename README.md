## React To-Do App ⚛️

A very simple, styled to-do app built entirely with **ES6 class-based components**.

Functional components + hooks are the cool new thing 🎸, but there are still plenty of code bases out there built with class components, so I wanted a sandbox to get to know them better. Ask a few personal questions.

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org) (16.10.2) and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Scripts 📜

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br />
